#casino lights

I figured I should have a play around with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). 
So I set myself the task of creating some casino style lights. The actual inspiration
being the Brighton Pier sign in my hometown.

Ideally I wanted to avoid the use of any images, which helps the effect to be scale
up to different font sizes. So it's all CSS3 and JavaScript.
