#Casino Lights

I figured I should have a play around with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org). 
So I set myself the task of creating some casino style lights.

Ideally I wanted to avoid the use of any images, which helps the effect to be scaled
up to different font sizes. So it's all CSS3 and JavaScript.

It's my first attempt at using Angular and on the whole I quite like it. I'm sure there are a few anti patterns here, so feel free to pick wholes in it and let me know.

A live demo is up and running on [thatguynamedandy](http://thatguynamedandy.com)
